All notable changes to Stock Spike Monitor.

## v2.2 — Graduated Trailing Stop (2026-03-15)

### Exit Strategy Overhaul
- Removed fixed 10% take-profit exit. Winners now ride with a graduated trailing stop that widens as profit grows:
  - `<5% profit`: 3% trail (base)
  - `5–10%`: 4% trail
  - `10–15%`: 5% trail
  - `15%+`: 6% trail (wide, let runners run)
- Hard stop (-6% from entry) remains as a safety net.
- Applied to both paper trading and backtest engine.

### Updated Notifications & Config
- BUY notifications now show graduated trail zones instead of a fixed target price.
- `/set` display shows the graduated trail table. `/set take_profit` now explains the new system.
- Adaptive config no longer adjusts `PAPER_TAKE_PROFIT_PCT` (graduated trail replaces it).

## v2.1 — Portfolio Value Fix, Command Menu & TP Bot Cleanup (2026-03-15)

### Bug Fixes
- `/tp` portfolio value now uses live market prices instead of cost basis (avg_price). Previously always showed ~$100,000 regardless of actual market value.
- `post_init` callback for `set_my_commands` wasn't firing in dual-bot mode. Moved command registration inline into `_run_both()`.

### Improvements
- Command menus registered for both private and group chat scopes (`BotCommandScopeAllPrivateChats` + `BotCommandScopeAllGroupChats`).
- Removed `/paper` command from TP bot — TP bot now focuses exclusively on TradersPost trading.
- Renamed all user-visible "Shadow Portfolio" references to "TP Portfolio" throughout the TP bot.
- Updated TP bot welcome, help, and command descriptions to reflect independent trading (not shadow/mirror).
